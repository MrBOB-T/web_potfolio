            <p><strong>"Moving Magic Square" Java Program</strong><br>
                One project I worked on during my studies was called "Moving Magic Square." It's a Java program based on the concept of a magic square game. So, in the game, players have a grid containing positive integer numbers, and they need to move a specific number (usually represented as '9') within the grid to achieve a goal state. The goal state is where the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal equals a predefined value.</p>
            <p>To solve this problem, I implemented an algorithm using object-oriented programming concepts in Java. I defined a class called State, which represents a state of the game. This class includes variables to store the board configuration, heuristic value, and position of the movable number. I also implemented methods to perform moves, generate children states, and print the contents of a state.</p>
            <p>To efficiently handle state transitions, I utilized a PriorityQueue (PQ) data structure to store the frontier list of expanded states. States were sorted in ascending order based on their heuristic values. The algorithm iteratively expanded states, generating children states and adding them to the PriorityQueue until a goal state was reached or a maximum number of moves was exceeded.</p>
            <p>For example, given an initial state of the grid, the program would explore possible moves of the movable number ('9') and prioritize them based on their heuristic values. It would continue to expand states and move towards a goal state where the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal equals the predefined value. The program prints each state and its heuristic value during execution, allowing us to visualize the progress.</p>
            <p>To ensure efficiency, I carefully designed the algorithm to prioritize moves based on heuristic values, allowing the program to explore promising state transitions first. Additionally, I extensively tested the program on various initial states and verified the correctness of the output against expected results. I also implemented error handling and ensured the program gracefully handles edge cases.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills gained from the project:</strong> The skills and experience gained from working on this project are highly transferable to real-world software development scenarios. These include proficiency in Java programming, algorithm design, data structure utilization, testing, debugging, and problem-solving. Additionally, the project demonstrates the ability to analyze requirements, design solutions, and implement robust, efficient software systems, which are essential skills in professional software development environments.</p>
